  <h2>Plans</h2>
  <p>
  The first working release of the argouml-sql module is planned for around 
  15 April 2007. With this release you can:
  <ul>
  	<li>Build a class diagram that represents a logical relational data 
  	    model</li>
  	<li>Generate sql for at least one database system</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="h2">
  <h2>Roadmap</h2>
  After the release in April there still is work to be done (in no specific 
  order):
  <ul>
  	<li>Implement code generators for the most common database systems</li>
    <li><a href="ParsingDDLScript.html">Parsing of SQL DDL scripts</a></li>
  	<li>Reverse engineering of databases</li>
  	<li>Special attribute notation for relational models (like in real database 
  	modelling tools</li>
  	<li>Assist the user in building a relational model (auto-creation of foreign 
  	key attributes for associations for example)</li>
  	<li>Auto-create a relational model out of a class diagram</li>
  	<li>perhaps more...</li>
  </ul>
