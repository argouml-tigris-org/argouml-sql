			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				This small tutorial will show you how to build a simple model that can be used to
				generate DDL-statements.

			<h2>Modelling a table</h2>
			<p>
				A table can be modelled using an UML class. The sample table contains a primary key 
				attribute, and the attributes "name" and the "place". The attribute address_id is 
				of the stereotype &lt;&lt;PK&gt;&gt;. That way it is marked as part of the primary 
				key of this table.

			<h2>Defining domains</h2>
			<p>
				Since most databases don't have a datatype like "int" or "String" we must map these
				abstract datatypes to real ones. For this purpose there exists a settings tab in
				ArgoUML. It can be reached through Edit -> Settings -> ArgoUML-SQL. As can be seen 
				there already are some mappings defined.

			<h2>Modelling a relationship</h2>
			<p>
				In the following diagramm you can see two tables. Each was modelled as described 
				above. There already exists an association named "fk_person_address" between these
				tables. There is exactly one address for any person. And one address can be used 
				by zero, one ore more persons.
			</p>
			
			<div style="text-align: center">
				<img src="img/relationship_fk_person_address.png" />
			</div>
			
			<p>
				The next step is to add a foreign key attribute to the table "Person". This will be
				used to realise the relationship in a relational database. A foreign key attribute
				is an attribute with the stereotyp &lt;&lt;FK&gt;&gt;.
			</p>
			
			<div style="text-align: center">
				<img src="img/attribute_address_id.png" />
			</div>			
			
			<p>
				Now we must tell ArgoUML what relationship this foreign key attribute is referring. 
				To accomplish this we need to define a tagged value for this attribute. The tag name 
				must be "association_name", the value must be "fk_person_address" - the name of the 
				relationship.
			</p>
